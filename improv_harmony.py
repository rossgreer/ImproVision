# setup: 4 musicians, in a semi-circle around camera, nobody directly in the middle

# default camera position: horizontally level, facing middle of semi-circle


# CUES: 

# first, cue in individually - musicians should take notice of communication and remember it until final cue
# for each musician you want to change, from left to right:
#   make 'eye contact'
#   wait 1 second
#   small nod up (i.e., quickly tilt 30? 45? degrees upward, then return to default state): move up 1 half step
#   big nod up (i.e., quickly tilt 60? 90? degrees upward, then return to default state): move up 1 whole step
#   small nod down: move down 1 half step
#   big nod down: move down 1 whole step
#   if you want more than 1 whole step:
#       pause 0.5 seconds while continuing to look at musician
#       then nod again
#   then turn to the next musician you want to change

# once all individual cues have taken place:
#   pan around
#   return to default state (facing the middle)
#   then big nod (90 degrees upward, then return to default state) to cue simultaneous changes
